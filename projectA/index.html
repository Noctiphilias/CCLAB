                <p id="para">This creature emerges from the depths of neurodiversity, clutching the identity of ADHD. Its energy surges at random intervals, speeding and growing. It prefers to be surrounded by people and dopamine/happiness since that is its source of food. It will go to you if you extend yourself to it, and if you back away, it’ll get smaller as a result. It is a friend that is born within the brains of people, often confused as a disease. If it were to be released into the wild, it would be unable to survive due to the lack of dopamine it would receive.
